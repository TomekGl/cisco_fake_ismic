 * \brief ISMIC interface implementation
 *
 * \details This module implements very basic functionality of ISMIC.
 * ISMIC in HP BladeSystem enables communication between chassis' Onboard
 * Administrator and removable devices such as servers, switches etc.
 * This is only switch<->ISMIC chip implementation, ISMIC<->OA protocol is
 * unknown due to lack of such hardware.
 *
 * ISMIC stores multiple sequence of bytes, organized into banks. Lenght of banks
 * varies. Banks can be written by device and read by OM, set by OM and read
 * by device, or written and read by both sides.
